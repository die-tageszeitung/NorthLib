/**
 A ZoomedImageView presents an Image in an ImageView that is scrollable
 and zoomable.
 
 It consists of an ImageView managed by a ScrollView and an additional x-shaped
 button which may be used to terminate the ImageView. The button is only visible
 when a closure is defined that is called when the button has been pressed.
 
 The ImageView displays an OptionalImage. If the main image is available, zooming
 and scrolling of that image is enabled. Initially the image is sized and
 positioned so that it is completely visible but couldn't be enlarged without
 cropping a part of the image. If the main image is not available, the waiting image
 is displayed without being zoomable or scrollable and a spinner is shown in
 the centre of the view.
 
 If the main image is displayed a double tap either enlarges the image so that
 its resolution matches the resolution of the screen or (if already enlarged)
 it is shrinked to its initial size and position.

/**
 An ImageCollectionVC utilizes PageCollectionVC to show a collection of ZoomedImageViews.
 
 After being initialized the attribute 'images' is set to contain an array of
 OptionalImageItem. The attribute 'index' (from PageCollectionVC) is used to point
 to that image which is to display on the screen. Each zoomable image fills the complete
 space of ImageCollectionVCs view. Hence the size of every cell of the collection
 view is identical to the size of the collection view's self.view.
 ImageCollectionVC displays an xButton alike ZoomedImageView's xButton which by default
 (no 'onX' closure was specified) performs
    self.navigationController?.popViewController(animated: true)
       or
    self.presentingViewController.dismiss(...)
 if the X has been tapped.
 
 To indicate on which page a user is currently positioned a PageControl is displayed
 if there are more than one image. The ImageCollectionVC only updates the pageControl
 attributes:
   currentPage - to indicate which image is displayed
   numberOfPages - to specify how many dots are displayed in total
 In Case of too many Pages, the PageControll dots are cut of at the Edge of the CollectionView. IN that Case we can limit the max shown dots with: pageControlMaxDotsCount. Set pageControlMaxDotsCount = 0 would display all dots no matter if they can be shown.

/**
 The Overlay class manages the two view controllers 'overlay' and 'active'.
 'active' is currently visible and 'overlay' will be presented on top of
 'active'. To accomplish this, two views are created, the first one, 'shadeView'
 is positioned on top of 'active.view' with the same size and colored 'shadeColor'
 with an alpha between 0...maxAlpha. This view is used to shade the active view
 controller during the open/close animations. The second view, overlayView is
 used to contain 'overlay' and is animated during opening and closing operations.
 In addition two gesture recognizers (pinch and pan) are used on shadeView to
 start the close animation. The pan gesture is used to move the overlay to the
 bottom of shadeView. The pinch gesture is used to shrink the overlay
 in size while being centered in shadeView. When 'overlay' has been shrunk to
 'closeRatio' (see attribute) or moved 'closeRatio * overlayView.bounds.size.height'
 points to the bottom then 'overlay' is animated automatically away from the
 screen. While the gesture recognizers are working or during the animation the
 alpha of shadeView is changed to reflect the animation's ratio (alpha = 0 =>
 'overlay' is no longer visible). The gesture recognizers coexist with gesture
 recognizers being active in 'overlay'.
