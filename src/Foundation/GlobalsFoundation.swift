/**
 Executes the passed closure on one of the system's global dispatch queues
 depending on the given quality of service *qos*.
 
 The system maintains a number of threads with different scheduling priorities.
 Using the argument *qos* you select an appropriate thread with its dispatch queue
 for the execution of *closure* concurrently to the main thread.
 If given with the argument *after* the execution is delayed by *after* seonds.
 
 - Parameters:
   - qos: quality of service (default: .userInitiated)
   - after: Number of seconds to defer the execution
   - queue: optional dispatch queue to execute *closure* on
   - closure: closure to execute

/**
 Executes the passed closure asynchronously on main thread.
 
 Similar to the global *async* function *onMain* executes a closure asynchronously.
 Unlike *async* the closure is started on the main thread, ie. that thread which
 performs all user interaction.
 
 - Parameters:
   - after: Number of seconds to defer the execution
   - closure: closure to execute
